Welcome to the Code/Application Page. This repository contains the BrightScript code for the exercises from Bootstrap Broadcast. Feel free to modify or build upon the code for your public or private channel. Developing a basic roku channel is not hard, you just need the right code.  Make sure you the video links you embed in your code are playable in any web browser.

Have fun!
